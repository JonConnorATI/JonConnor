Jon Connor, Dublin.

Software Tester - Manual and Automation (Java/Selenium).

I am looking to get on a project where I can use my abilities, of talking to the users, and identifying missing or incomplete requirements, along with my self-taught automation skills to help deliver the software that the business wants.

Get me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonconnordublin/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or drop me an <a href="mailto:jonconnor@live.ie" target="_blank">Email</a> for a chat about any projects or roles you have coming up.

Please view my projects here, and if you have any suggestions or feedback I would love to hear it:

<ul>
    <li>Two Cucumber test frameworks: <a href="https://github.com/JonConnorATI/Shopping" target="_blank">Shopping</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JonConnorATI/Donuts" target="_blank">Donuts</a>. Created the frameworks to 'test' these active commercial websites, <a href="https://www.mandmdirect.ie/" target="_blank">M and M direct</a> and <a href="https://offbeatdonuts.com/" target="_blank">offBeatDonuts</a>, which includes a method to use Chrome, Edge or Firefox browsers. As I've updated the frameworks to use WebDriver Manager, there's no need to download the webdrivers for the browsers. View the latest runs in these cucumber reports <a href="https://reports.cucumber.io/report-collections/2b0c2440-037f-402f-84e1-6cbaf2cc13b4" target="_blank">Shopping</a> and <a href="https://reports.cucumber.io/report-collections/82dbbe5c-51d5-49a2-b632-79ed41f3c418" target="_blank">Donuts</a>.</li>
    <li>I've replicated the Donuts Cucumber framework as a java TestNG framework using the page object model - <a href="https://github.com/JonConnorATI/donutsPageObjectModel" target="_blank">POM Donuts</a>. Again this framework uses WebDriver Manager, so no webdrivers are needed.</li>
    <li>This is a Robot Framework version of the same tests but written using the built in Browser (playwright) library. Check it out, <a href="https://github.com/JonConnorATI/RobotDonuts" target="_blank">Robot Donuts</a>. </li>
    <li>Some web content I created to highlight my skills and what I know about cucumber - <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/" target="_blank">About Me</a> includes <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/bdd.html" target="_blank">BDD/Cucumber/Automation</a></li>
    <li>A web page I created to test a simple input/output rule - <a href ="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/Grades.html" target="_blank">Grades</a> - Takes an input and grades it. Used in the <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/automation.html" target="_blank">Automation</a> section of <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/" target="_blank">About Me</a> to show and explain how cucumber works.</li>
    <li>A web page I created after an interview because the question threw me for a second and I realised how much I take for granted - <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/JonConnorSWTester/bugreport.html" target="_blank">Bug Reports</a> - a reminder of the information for a good bug report and why we need it.</li>
    <!--<li>A web page I created - <a href="https://jonconnorati.github.io/Membership-ChristmasCountdown/" target="_blank">Christmas Countdown</a> - a chrsitmas countdown for a friend who loves Christmas.</li>-->
    <li>More to come, I'm currently looking at working with API's and restAssured. Check back soon</li>
</ul>
